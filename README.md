# University-Dissertation
This is the application I created as part of my dissertation for my BSc Maths and Computer Science degree I obtained from the University of Birmingham. It is an an application for teaching musical harmony, created using the visual programming language Max.
The Max patch files can only be viewed in the visual format they were created in using a windows device with a liscenced copy of Max installed, and as such the raw code generated by Max, as can be found in this repository, can be difficult to comprehend/interpret. The application can be run on a windows machine without a liscenced version of Max by unzipping 'Musical Harmony Explained.zip' and running the file 'Musical Harmony Explained.exe'. Beware that this is a fairly bloated folder as much of the Max runtime had to be included for the application to be run on a machine that doesn't have Max installed.
Also included in this repository is the report I submitted with the application which gives a high level explanation of the code, with images of the visual presentation of the patches' code and an evaluation of the project.
